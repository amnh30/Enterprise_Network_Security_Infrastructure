# Enterprise Network Security Infrastructure — Final Project (NTI Network Security Internship)
![Project Banner](Redesigned%20Network%20Security%20Architecture.png)
## Overview

This repository contains all project assets, configurations, and documentation for a simulated **enterprise-grade secure network** developed as the final project for the **Network Security Internship (NTI)**.

The design implements:

* **Layered security** (firewalls, ACLs, VLAN segmentation)
* **Dynamic routing** with OSPF across 9 routers
* **Site-to-site VPN** using ISAKMP and IPSec
* **Centralized AAA** with TACACS+ and RADIUS
* **Infrastructure services** (Syslog, NTP)
* **Switch security** (Port Security, Trunking, VLANs)

The setup was built and tested using Cisco IOS (Packet Tracer compatible).

## Repository Contents

* `Configs.txt` — Complete router and switch configuration commands
* `Project.pkt` — Cisco Packet Tracer project file
* `Connections.xlsx` — Network device connection map and IP addressing table
* `Redesigned Network Security Architecture.png` — Detailed network topology diagram
* `Capture.PNG` — Screenshot of final network running
* `README.md` — This documentation file

## Skills Demonstrated

* Network Security Architecture
* OSPF Routing Configuration
